* A Webtask script which accepts image URLs to be uploaded to an [Imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/CLCcl) (which will only accept images)
* A Slack bot which listens for any URLs being shared, and tries passes them to the above Webtask script for uploading to Imgur.  The demo Slack group is here: [https://slacksandboxteamgroup.slack.com](https://slacksandboxteamgroup.slack.com)
